# Syntax

## Cuts {#cuts}

**User shall be able to describe a real number using two formulas describing lower and upper part of the cut.**

Rationale: Provide a general way to enter a real numbe,r while keeping enough information to compute it.
Don't provide or fix the method of computation.
